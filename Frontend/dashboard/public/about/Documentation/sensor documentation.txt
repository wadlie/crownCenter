1. Last Updated Table
    a. Each sensor will have a row containing which state and farm it is from and how long it has been since the last update
    b. State
        I. The two letter state code can be filtered through the text box
        II. The filtering is case insensitive
    c. Farm Code
        I. The three letter farm code can also be filtered through the respective text box
        II. The filtering is case insensitive
    d. Hours Since Last Update
        I. This signifies the last time the sensor has uploaded data to the database
        II. Coloring
            i. Green for updates under 1 hours
            ii. Yellow for updates under 1.5 hours

2. Sensor Summary
    a. Each sensor will have a row containing a brief summary of metrics
    b. Metrics:
        I. State: The state in which the sensor is operating in
        II. Farm Code: The farm code that represents the farm that the sensor is operating in
        III. Total # of Readings: Total readings that the sensor has made
        IV. Total # of RH: Total readings of sensor data where a relative humidity was recorded
        V. # of B Treatments: Total readings of sensor data for bareground treatment
        VI. # of C Treatments: Total readings of sensor data for cover crop treatment
        VII. Last RH: Latest timestamp for a record of sensor data where a relative humidity was recorded
        VIII. Last B Treatment: Latest timestamp for a record of sensor data for bareground treatment
        IX. Last C Treatment: Latest timestamp for a record of sensor data for cover crop treatment
